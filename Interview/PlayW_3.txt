Playwright?
Playwright, being a tool primarily designed for
browser automation, does not inherently include

When using Playwright with a testing framework
such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine, you typically use
the assertion methods provided by those
frameworks. Here are some commonly used

• expect(value).toBe(expected)
• expect(value).toEqual(expected)
