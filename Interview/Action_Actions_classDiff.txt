Key Differences Between Actions Class and Action Interface:

1. Type:

*   Actions is a class.
*   Action is an interface.

2. Purpose:

*   Actions is used to build a sequence of complex user interactions like mouse movements, clicks, key presses, etc. It supports method chaining.
*   Action represents a single, executable action and provides the perform() method to execute that action.

3. Methods:

*   Actions includes multiple utility methods like moveToElement(), clickAndHold(), dragAndDrop(), etc.
*   Action only includes the perform() method.

4. Usage:

*   The Actions class is used to create and configure complex actions and generates Action objects that can be executed.
*   The Action interface is implemented to execute a specific action.

// Using Actions class

Actions actions = new Actions(driver); 

actions.moveToElement(element).click().build().perform(); // Chaining actions

// Using Action interface

Action action = actions.moveToElement(element).click().build(); 
// Build returns an Action action.perform(); // Execute the single action
