Answer:
Playwright is an open-source automation framework
developed by Microsoft that allows developers to
automate web applications across various browsers
and platforms. It supports multiple programming
languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
C#, and Java. Playwright enables end-to-end
testing by simulating user interactions such as clicks,
form submissions, and navigation.
Its key features include multi-browser support
(Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit), automatic waiting,
network interception, and the ability to capture
screenshots and videos during tests. This versatility
makes it a popular choice for developers looking to
ensure the functionality and performance of their
web applications.
2. How does Playwright
differ from Selenium?
Answer: Playwright differs from Selenium in several
significant ways:

4. Can you explain the
architecture of Playwright?
Answer: Playwright's architecture is designed to
facilitate efficient browser automation. It consists of
several components:
• Browser Contexts: Each browser context is an
isolated environment where tests can run
independently. This allows for parallel testing
without interference between tests.
• Pages: Each context can contain multiple pages
(tabs), which represent different views or states
of a web application.
• Locators: Playwright uses locators to identify
elements on a page. These locators can be
based on CSS selectors, text content, or other
attributes.
• API Communication: Instead of relying on
WebDriver's HTTP requests, Playwright
communicates directly with the browser via the
Dev Tools protocol. This direct communication
enhances performance and reliability.
5. How do you install
Playwright?

7. How does Playwright
handle asynchronous
operations?
Answer: Playwright is built on top of JavaScript's
asynchronous programming model using Promises
and async/await syntax. This means that when you
perform actions such as navigating to a page or
clicking an element, these operations return promises
that must be awaited before proceeding to the next
action. For example:
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
const browser = await
chromium.launch();
})();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
const title = await page.title();
console.log(title);
await browser.close();
In this example, each action waits for the previous
one to complete before moving forward.
8. Can you describe how to
handle dynamic content in
Playwright?
Answer:

waiting for elements to appear or change state
before interacting with them You can use methods
In this example, each action waits for the previous
one to complete before moving forward.
8. Can you describe how to
handle dynamic content in
Playwright?
Answer:
Handling dynamic content in Playwright involves
waiting for elements to appear or change state
before interacting with them. You can use methods
like waitForSelector or waitForTimeout to manage
timing issues effectively:
await page.waitForSelector('.dynamic-
element', { state: 'visible' });
This line ensures that the script waits until the
specified element is visible on the page before
proceeding with further actions.
9. What are some common
assertions used in
Playwright?
Answer:
Assertions are crucial in validating test outcomes.
While Playwright itself does not provide built-in
assertion methods, it integrates seamlessly with
popular testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha that
offer assertion capabilities. Common assertions
include:
• Visibility Check:
await expect(element).toBeVisible();
specified element is visible on the page before
proceeding with further actions.

elements:
const input = await
page.$('input[type="file"]');
await
input.setInputFiles('/path/to/file.txt');
This code snippet selects a file input element and
sets it with a specified file path, simulating a user
uploading a file through the interface.
11. Can you explain how to
perform mobile testing using
Playwright?
Answer: Playwright provides built-in support for
mobile device emulation through its devices module.
You can specify a device configuration when creating
a new browser context:
const { devices } = require('playwright');
const iPhone = devices ['iPhone 11'];
const context = await
browser.newContext(iPhone);
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
This code snippet sets up an emulated environment
that mimics an iPhone 11's screen size and
capabilities.

12. What are some common
exceptions encountered
while using Playwright?
Answer: While working with Playwright, developers
may encounter various exceptions such as:
• TimeoutError: Occurs when an operation takes
longer than expected.
• ElementNotFoundError: Raised when trying to
interact with an element that does not exist on
the page.
• NavigationError: Triggered when navigation
fails due to network issues or invalid URLs.
Handling these exceptions gracefully in your test
scripts is essential for robust automation.

13. How do you implement
parallel testing in
Playwright?
Answer: Parallel testing in Playwright can be
achieved by launching multiple browser contexts or
instances simultaneously within your test suite. You
can utilize test runners like Jest or Mocha that
support parallel execution natively:
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
const browser = await
chromium.launch();
// Create multiple contexts
const context1 = await
browser.newContext();
const context2 = await
browser.newContext();
// Run tests in parallel across
contexts
const page1 = await context1.newPage();
const page2 = await context2.newPage();
await Promise.all([
]);
page1.goto('https://example.com'),
page2.goto('https://example.org')
})();
await browser.close();
This approach allows tests to run concurrently across
different contexts or pages.

14. Can you explain how
network interception works
in Playwright?
Answer: Network interception allows developers to
monitor and manipulate network requests made by
their application during tests. You can use
page.route() to intercept requests:
await page.route('**/*', (route) => {
// Modify request if needed
route.continue(); // Continue with the
original request
});
This capability is useful for mocking responses or
simulating different server conditions during testing.
15. How do you capture
screenshots during tests in
Playwright?
Answer: Capturing screenshots is straightforward in
Playwright using the screenshot() method:
await page.screenshot({ path:
'screenshot.png' });
You can also capture full-page screenshots by
setting the fullPage option:
await page.screenshot({ path:
'fullpage.png', fullPage: true });
Screenshots are valuable for visual regression testing
and debugging failed test cases.
and debugging failed test cases.
16. What strategies do you
use for handling iframes in
Playwright?
Answer: To interact with iframes in Playwright, you
first need to get a reference to the iframe's content
frame using frameLocator() or frame() methods:
const frame = await page.frame({ name:
'iframeName' });
await frame.fill('#inputField', 'Test
Input');
This approach allows you to perform actions within
an iframe just like you would on a regular page.
17. How do you set up test
fixtures in Playwright?
Answer: Test fixtures help manage setup and
teardown processes consistently across tests. In Jest
or Mocha (or similar frameworks), you can define
fixtures using hooks like beforeEach or afterEach:
beforeEach(async () => {
context = await browser.newContext();
page = await context.newPage();
});
afterEach(async () => {
await context.close();
});
This structure ensures that each test runs in a fresh
environment without side effects from previous tests.

environment without side effects from previous tests.
18. Can you describe how to
manage dependencies
between tests using
Playwright?
Answer: Managing dependencies between tests
typically involves careful design of your test suite
where each test is independent whenever possible.
However, if dependencies are unavoidable (e.g.,
setup data required by subsequent tests), consider
using global variables or state management
techniques:
let sharedData;
beforeAll(async () => {
sharedData = await setupData(); //
Prepare data needed by multiple tests
});
test('Test A', async () => {
expect(await
});
getData(sharedData)).toBe(true);
test('Test B', async () => {
expect(await
validateData(sharedData)).toBe(true);
});
This ensures that shared data is prepared once but
used across multiple tests without redundancy.
19. How do you perform
data-driven testing using
Playwright?
19. How do you perform
data-driven testing using
Playwright?
Answer: Data-driven testing involves running the
same test logic with different sets of data inputs. You
can achieve this by parameterizing your tests using
external data sources such as JSON files or
databases:
const testData = require('./data.json');
testData.forEach(data => {
=> {
test('Testing ${data.input}`, async ()
const result = await
performAction(data.input);
expect(result).toBe(data.expectedOutput);
});
});
By iterating over datasets, this approach enhances
coverage without duplicating code.

21. How can you run tests in
headless and headed modes
in Playwright?
Answer:
In Playwright, you can toggle between headless and
headed modes by setting the headless option when
launching a browser. Headless mode means the
browser runs without a visible Ul, which is faster and
ideal for CI/CD pipelines. Headed mode is useful for
debugging. For example:
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
const browser = await chromium.launch({
headless: false }); // Set to true for
headless mode
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
