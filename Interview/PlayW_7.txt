1. Difference between fill and type methods in Playwright
fill: Replaces any existing input with new input without delay.
type: Simulates keypresses, so it's slower and doesn't replace
existing input.
2. Assertions in Playwright
Assertions verify conditions during test execution using the
expect function:
Visibility:.toBeVisible(), .toBeHidden()
Text Content: .toHaveText(), .toHaveValue()
Attributes/Properties: .toHaveAttribute(), .toHaveCSS()
Existence: .toExist(), .toHaveCount()
State: .toBeChecked(), .toBeEnabled(), .toBeDisabled()
3. Assertion for checkboxes
Use .toBeChecked() to assert checkbox states.
4. Handling Multiple Tabs in Playwright
You can manage multiple tabs by using browser.newPage() to
open new tabs and interacting with each as separate Page
objects. To switch tabs, reference the Page object for each tab:
Open a new tab: browser.newPage()
Switch between tabs: page.bringToFront()
Close a tab: page.close()
5. Handling Lists with nth in Playwright
Use :nth-child() or :nth-of-type() selectors in CSS or .nth(index)
in Playwright's Locator API to interact with lists of elements.
6. Navigating to a URL in Playwright
Use .goto() to navigate to any page.
7. Debugging in Playwright
Run tests in headful mode for Ul visibility.
Use page.pause() to pause and interact with tests in Playwright
Inspector.
Use console.log() for logging, and the --debug flag for detailed
logs.
Use .goto() to navigate to any page.
7. Debugging in Playwright
Run tests in headful mode for UI visibility.
Use page.pause() to pause and interact with tests in Playwright
Inspector.
Use console.log() for logging, and the --debug flag for detailed
logs.
For advanced debugging, connect to DevTools Protocol.
8. Handling Dynamic Elements
Dynamic elements change over time. Use waitForSelector() to
ensure elements are ready before interacting with them:
Wait for visibility: { state: 'visible' }
Handle modals/popups: Wait for full load with waitForEvent()
9. Hooks in Playwright
Playwright provides hooks for setup/teardown:
beforeAll(), beforeEach(): Setup before tests.
afterEach(), afterAll(): Cleanup after tests.
You can also use fixtures for reusable logic.
10. Fixtures in Playwright
Fixtures help manage complex test setups and cleanups,
making your tests reusable and maintainable. Use built-in or
custom fixtures:
Built-in: page, browser, context
Custom: Create with test.extend()
Fixtures allow for better organization and reusability across
tests.
