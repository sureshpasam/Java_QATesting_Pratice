Just had an interview for a Selenium Java position and wanted
to share some of the key technical questions I was asked. These
could be helpful for anyone preparing for a similar role:
1. Write a program using a for loop with if-else conditions.
2. Why do we use HashMap? Write a program that uses a
HashMap with a String as input.
3. What's the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
Provide example programs for both.
4. Explain the difference between inheritance and abstraction.
Provide example programs for both.
5. How do you access multiple tabs in a browser? Share a
sample code for this.
6. Write a sample feature file for login and logout functionality.
7. What are the different types of locators? When do you use
XPath and when do you use CSS selectors?
8. Explain the framework being used in your project.
9. When working with an existing framework, and you notice
50 out of 100 test cases are running slower, what kind of waits
would you use and why?
10. How do you resolve conflicts in GitHub?
